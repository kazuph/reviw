Verify the following:\n\n□ Implementation Complete (1/3)\n  → Did the build succeed? (npm run build / pnpm build)\n  → Are there no type errors or lint errors?\n\n□ Verification Complete (2/3)\n  → [Web] Did you verify with webapp-testing skill (Playwright)?\n  → [Backend] Did you run the test suite with backend-testing skill (vitest/go test/pytest/cargo test)?\n  → [Mobile] Did you run Maestro E2E flows with mobile-testing skill?\n  → Did you collect evidence (screenshots/test output)?\n\n□ Review Complete (3/3)\n  → Is there evidence (screenshots/videos) in .artifacts/<feature=branch_name>/?\n  → Did you create a report using artifact-proof skill?\n  → Did you execute the /reviw-plugin:done command?\n  → Did you receive review by launching reviw in foreground?\n  → Did you get approval from the user?\n\n【Prohibited Actions】\n  ✗ Reporting only \"Implementation done!\"\n  ✗ Declaring completion without testing\n  ✗ Reporting \"It works!\" without evidence\n  ✗ Committing/pushing before reviw review\n  ✗ Ignoring new user requests without adding to TodoList\n\n【If the above is incomplete】\n  → Do not report completion; communicate what should be done next\n  → Execute /reviw-plugin:done command to proceed to review flow"
